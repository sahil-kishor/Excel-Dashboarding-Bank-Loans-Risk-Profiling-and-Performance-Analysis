# Banking Dynamic Risk Profiling and Performance Analysis in Consumer Lending

# Project Objective:

The aim of this project is to leverage advanced data analysis techniques within Excel to gain a thorough understanding and improve the management of a consumer loan portfolio. This entails evaluating loan risk profiles, analyzing financial performance metrics, uncovering borrower behavior patterns, and ultimately developing a dynamic, interactive Excel dashboard. The goal is to offer strategic recommendations that optimize loan portfolio management, mitigate risks, and enhance decision-making processes for financial institutions and stakeholders in the consumer lending industry.

- emp_length_int: Borrower’s employment length in years.

- home_ownership: Borrower’s housing status (e.g., own, rent).

- home_ownership_cat: Encoded housing status.

- income_category: Categorical income level of the borrower.

- annual_inc: Borrower’s annual income.

- income_cat: Encoded income category.

- loan_amount: Borrowed amount.

- term: Loan term in months or years.

- term_cat: Encoded loan term.

- application_type: Individual or joint loan application.

- application_type_cat: Encoded application type.

- purpose: Loan purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement).

- purpose_cat: Encoded loan purpose.

- interest_payments: Description of interest payments (e.g., high, low).

- interest_payment_cat: Encoded interest payment description.

- loan_condition: Loan status (Good Loan, Bad Loan).

- loan_condition_cat: Encoded loan condition.

- interest_rate: Loan interest rate.

- grade: Assessment of the loan’s risk.

- grade_cat: Encoded loan grade.

- dti: Borrower’s debt-to-income ratio.

- total_pymnt: Total payments made to date.

- total_rec_prncp: Total principal received to date.

- recoveries: Amount recovered after loan default.

- installment: Borrower’s monthly payment.

- region: Borrower’s geographical region.

# Tasks Executed:

+ Income Category and Loan Amount Correlation: Analyzed the correlation between borrowers' income categories and loan amounts.

+ Region-wise Loan Analysis: Identified the region with the highest number of loans and visualized the regional loan distribution.

+ Debt-to-Income Ratio Insights: Computed and assessed the average debt-to-income ratio for each loan grade.

+ Loan Amount vs. Annual Income: Created a scatter plot to examine the relationship between loan amounts and borrowers' annual incomes.

+ Grade-wise Profitability Analysis: Calculated loan profitability (total payments received minus the loan amount) for each grade.

+ Predictive Analysis for Loan Defaults: Used advanced Excel functions to predict default likelihood based on loan amount, income, and employment length.
Risk Analysis Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard to present insights about loan grades and associated risks.
Key Findings:
Loan Status: 87% of the loans are classified as good, while 13% are bad.
Risk Grades: Grade A loans pose the least risk, while Grade G loans are the riskiest with high-interest rates and debt-to-income ratios.
Defaulter Analysis: Debt consolidation and credit card loans have the highest number of defaulters, with 5,398 and 1,492 respectively.
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Loans graded E and F have the highest debt-to-income ratios.
Income and Defaults: Most defaults occur in the low annual income group, which also faces higher interest rates.
Regional Distribution: Cannaught has the highest loan count at 11,444, while Munster has the lowest at 7,397.
Home Ownership: Loans for mortgage and rent home ownership types see the highest default rates.
Profitability Insights: Loans for small businesses exhibit the highest profitability index and fewer defaults, making them a strategic focus for lenders.
Conclusion:
This project provides a deep dive into consumer loan data, revealing significant insights and patterns that can drive better loan portfolio management. The findings suggest strategic shifts towards lending for small businesses and caution in high-risk categories such as debt consolidation and low-income borrowers. By using Excel’s powerful analytical tools, financial institutions can better predict defaults and enhance decision-making processes to optimize performance and mitigate risks in consumer lending.
